# CodeExamples
Just a collection of projects and code examples for myself

I initially made this repo to store code and patterns that I really enjoyed creating or thought were neat concepts. It has not been updated in a while, and probably would change alot of the things I did. However, I did still enjoy these pieces of a whole.
